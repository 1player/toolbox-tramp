* Toolbox over TRAMP
** specifically toolbox support

Access Toolbox containers found on Fedora Silverblue (and workstation Fedora if you create them)

Inspired by docker-tramp, this instead uses toolbox commands for access to get podman/toolbox to stop pretending it's docker
This means container commands will run as a user and not as root.

** Finding a file inside a container:

#+begin_src 
/toolbox:<container>:path/to/file
#+end_src

The `<container>` flag is entirely optional and will select the default created toolbox container (`fedora-container-35`) if one exists.

** Installation
*** Straight
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package toolbox-tramp
  :straight (toolbox-tramp :type git
			   :host github
			   :repo "fejfighter/toolbox-tramp"))
#+end_src 

** Known Issues
*** Flatpak and process
Currently it will happily connect to the toolbox container, but there seems to be issues with launching the process.
